            This is only the automated packaging of the open sourced part of [Neo4j's Graph Data Science](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science) plugin.  
            Please visit [graph-data-science](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science) for more details.  

            ## Installation 
             
            Copy the JAR that suits your installation into the plugin directory of Neo4j.  
            See [Neo4j Graph Data Science Installation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation) for more details.  
            
            ## Notes

            :warning: This repository is only meant to be a personal workaround for the missing official OpenGDS plugin release artifacts.  
            :warning: It is strongly recommended to switch to an official OpenGDS package as soon there is one.
