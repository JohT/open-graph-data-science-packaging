# Open Neo4j Graph Data Science Packaging

Packages "OpenGDS", the open edition of [Neo4j's graph-data-science](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science/tree/master#opengds) using [GitHub Actions Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows). Automates the generation of the Neo4j plugin JAR for the OpenGDS.

:warning: This repository is only meant to be a personal workaround for the missing official OpenGDS plugin release artifacts.  

:warning: It is strongly recommended to switch to an official OpenGDS bundle as soon there is one.
